Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted 
One moment 
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now 
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No 
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes 
It don't matter, 
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke 
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping 
This world is mine for the taking 
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter 
Lonely roads, God only knows 
He's grown farther from home, he's no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmo who flows 
He nose dove and sold nada 
So the soap opera is told and unfolds 
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on 
Da da dumb da dumb da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
No more games, I'm a change what you call rage 
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged 
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher 
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my nine to five 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot, 
another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot. 
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
