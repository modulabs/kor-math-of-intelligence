This is the code for "Probability Theory - The Math of Intelligence #6" By Siraj Raval on Youtube

Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday July 27 2017 at 12 PM PST

Write your own Naive Bayes Classifer for any text dataset. Any improvements from my code in the video, (example - Using n-grams instead of counting individual words, TFIDF instead of bag of words, etc.) will be bonus points. Good luck!

Overview

This is the code for this video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of The Math of Intelligence course. I uses a Naive Bayes classifier to label some text as spam or not spam by training on this Kaggle dataset as training data.

Dependencies

numpy
Install numpy using pip

Usage

Type python naive_bayes.py to run the code.
