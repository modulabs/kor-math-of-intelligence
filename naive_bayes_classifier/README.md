This is the code for "Probability Theory - The Math of Intelligence #6" By Siraj Raval on Youtube


## Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday July 27 2017 at 12 PM PST

Write your own Naive Bayes Classifer for any text dataset. Any improvements from my code in the video, (example - Using n-grams instead of counting individual words, TFIDF instead of bag of words, etc.) will be bonus points. Good luck! 

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/PrkiRVcrxOs) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of The Math of Intelligence course. I uses a Naive Bayes classifier to label some text as spam or not spam by training on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) Kaggle dataset as training data.

## Dependencies

* numpy

Install numpy using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)


## Usage

Type `python naive_bayes.py` to run the code.
